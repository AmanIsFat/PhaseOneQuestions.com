					Dear Bibek,<br>
					<p>
						We had planned to visit a new place at the <br>weekend so we visited Dubai. It's a beautiful and<br>
						attractive place in the middle-east probably one of the <br>best in gulf countries. It has many beautiful places in<br>
						which I personally liked the Burj Khalifa the most. It is so <br>tall that you have to bend your head to look at its apex. I<br>
						suggest you to visit it once.
					</p>
					Best wishes,<br>
					Arjun
